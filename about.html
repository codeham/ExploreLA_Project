			<strong>WHY?</strong/><br/><br/>
			This website was created to for students or any individual in general who are
			low in income and would like to do something fun for a change without hurting
			their wallet and spending money that they shouldn't be spending. These places
			listed cost little to no money. Everyone wants to have fun, but not many 
			people are not financially fortunate enough to go out because money is an
			issue. This site is to help those people and to give new ideas to fun! Try 
			these places out and I'll guarantee you'll have a good time!<br/>
